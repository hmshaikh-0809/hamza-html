     cat  is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.
     Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling,
     hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language. 
     It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears,
     such as those made by small mammals.
